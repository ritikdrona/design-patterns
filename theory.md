# Design Patterns
A design pattern is a commonly accepted solution to a repeating problem. The Gang of Four is a group of who have shared 23 design patterns in their book. This repo is created with the motive of learning all of these 23 patterns.

The Gang of Four design patterns are divided into 3 categories, namely `creational`, `structural` and `behavioural` patterns.

## Creational Patterns
Creational design patterns are the ones which focus on the creation of an object.

### 1. Singleton Pattern
In singleton pattern, only one object of the required class is created and whenever an object of that class is required, the same object is fecthed and used. 

### 2. Builder Pattern
In builder pattern, we create a builder class for a required class which helps us to create an object and build it by setting values/properties one by one.

### 3. Factory Pattern
### 4. Abstract Factory Pattern
### 5. Prototype Pattern
